# Create or Recover Your Account

> If you already use Beacon, it is best to perform these steps inside Beacon because your existing private key will be the one backed up. Creating the account on the Beacon website will generate a new private key, which won't be able to decrypt your server link data in the [Servers config editor](/configs/deployments/), as well as any encrypted custom config content.

## Step 1: Get Started

### From Within Beacon

{% include usermenu.markdown %}

### From the Website

In the **Explore**{:.ui-keyword} menu, choose **Beacon Account**{:.ui-keyword} to be presented with the login form.

## Step 2: Verify Your E-Mail Address

Press **Create or Recover Account**{:.ui-keyword} and enter your email address to be sent a verification code.

> Although it's rare, sometimes these verification emails get delivered to spam boxes. Be sure to check there if your message is missing.

Follow the instructions in the verification email to continue.

## Step 3: Choose a Username and Password

Next you get to choose a username and password. The username is **not** used to sign in, it is only a display name. Currently, the only place it is displayed is your account control panel, the public project repository, and in the **Project Sharing**{:.ui-keyword} panel. Your username may contain spaces, special characters, and doesn't even need to be unique. There is even a link to suggest a mildly amusing Ark-themed username.

Passwords must be at least 8 characters long. While there are no other rules, your password will be securely checked against the [Have I Been Pwned Pwned Passwords Database](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords). For the security-minded, you can read more about how this service uses k-Anonymity to perform the check without exposing your password [here](https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/#cloudflareprivacyandkanonymity). Should you choose a password that has previously been leaked, you will be warned, but you will not be prevented from using the password anyway. Submit the form again if you really want to use the compromised password.
